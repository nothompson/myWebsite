			<p class = "media-caption" id = "title"> Supercollider with Webcam controls via TouchDesigner Spring 24 </p>
			<p class="media-caption"> Final project for Curtis Road's Music and Technology class. Pre-composed structure via supercollider tasks, with chaotic parameters that ensure a unique listening experience on every iteration. Everything synthesized from scratch. MediaPipe is a google Machine Learning framework that allows my webcam to capture where my fingers are and send OSC data to live granular controls in the supercollider code. All granular glyphs are made with claymation except the bottom left, which is stop-motion of me cracking a stone. It was an absolute honor being able to take a course under Curtis Roads and I am so grateful for the experience.
